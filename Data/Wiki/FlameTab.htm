<ul>
    <li>
        ==Color==

        These settings affect color. There is no set combination to make a perfect image. Once you've settled on a design you like,
        play with different color combinations to give it the desired final look.

        <ul>
            <li>
                ===Brightness===

                The brightness of the final output image.

                Range: 0.05 - 50.

                Render State: Density filtering.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Gamma===

                The gamma of the final output image. Higher values will give better color, but will reveal more scattered points.
                Lower values will reduce scattered points but will wash the colors out to white.

                Range: 1 - 9999.

                Render State: Final accumulation.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Gamma Threshold===

                The gamma threshold of the final output image. Higher values will reduce scattered points, but will also reduce color quality.
                Lower values will reveal more scattered points, but give better color. 

                Range: 0 - 10.

                Render State: Final accumulation.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Vibrancy===

                The scale factor to apply to the alpha channel log scaling when gamma correcting the final output image. Higher values will
                give more saturated colors. Lower values will wash the colors out to white.

                Range: 0 - 1.

                Render State: Final accumulation.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Highlight Power===

                The highlight power of the final image. Set this to a value greater than zero if the colors don't look right.

                A more thorough discussion of highlight power from the original flam3 documentation is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/flam3/wiki/HighlightPower">here</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/flam3/wiki/NewFeatures">here</a>.

                Range: -1 - 2.

                Render State: Final accumulation.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Background===

                The background color of the image. Ignored on the final image output if transparency is used.

                Range: 0-255 for RGB.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Palette Mode===

                The mode used for palette indexing when accumulating to the histogram.

                Step: If the specified palette index is a fraction, round down to the nearest integer.

                Linear: Blend the specified index with the one after it.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        ==Geometry==
        <ul>
            <li>
                ===Width===

                The width in pixels of the viewable area. Read only.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Height===

                The height in pixels of the viewable area. Read only.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Center X===

                The center offset of the camera. The image will move in the opposite direction on the X axis.

                Range: -10 - 10.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Center Y===

                The center offset of the camera. The image will move in the opposite direction on the Y axis.

                Range: -10 - 10.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Scale===

                The number of pixels in the final image that correspond to the distance from 0 to 1 in the Cartesian rendering plane.
                Increasing zooms in, decreasing zooms out. Quality is not scaled when this value is adjusted, so increased values
                will degrade the final image quality.

                Range: 10 - 3000.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Zoom===

                The zoom level of the final image. Quality is scaled when this value is adjusted, so rendering time is greatly increased.

                Range: 0 - 5.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Rotate===

                The rotation of the final image.

                Range: -180 - 180.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        ==Filter==
        <ul>
            <li>
                ===Spatial Filter Width===

                The width of the spatial filter applied to the final image.

                Range: 0.1 - 10.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Spatial Filter Type===

                The type of the spatial filter applied to the final image.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Temporal Filter Width===

                The width of the temporal filter used during animation. This value has no effect on the
                interactive renderer, however it's stored in the Xml when saved.

                Render State: Unchanged.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Temporal Filter Type===

                The type of the temporal filter used during animation. This value has no effect on the
                interactive renderer, however it's stored in the Xml when saved.

                Render State: Unchanged.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===DE Filter Min Radius===

                The minimum filter radius to use when performing density filtering. Increasing this value
                will add additional blurring even in high density areas, which is generally undesirable. This must
                always be less than or equal to the DE max radius.

                A more thorough discussion of density filtering from the original flam3 documentation is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/flam3/wiki/DensityEstimation">here</a>.

                Range: 0 - 25.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===DE Filter Max Radius===

                The maximum filter radius to use when performing density filtering. Increasing this value
                will add additional blurring only to low density areas, which is generally desirable. This must
                always be greater than or equal to the DE min radius.

                When using OpenCL, if this value multiplied by the supersample is greater than 9, the performance
                of density filtering will drop to that of the CPU. This is because a filter size greater than 9
                cannot fit into local shared memory.

                Range: 0 - 25.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===DE Curve===

                The speed with which the density filter values decrease when moving away from the center pixel
                being filtered. This value will almost never need to be anything other than the default of 0.40.

                Range: 0.01 - 5.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        ==Iteration==
        <ul>
            <li>
                ===Passes===

                The number of steps to break iteration into, applying density filtering each time.

                This value should never be anothing other than one and will most likely be removed in a future release.

                Range: 1 - 3.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Temporal Samples===

                The number of temporal samples used to blend between frames during animation. This value has no effect on the
                interactive renderer, however it's stored in the Xml when saved.

                Range: 1 - 5,000.

                Render State: Unchanged.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Quality===

                The number of iterations per pixel in the final output image. Suggested values:

                CPU, Interactive: 10

                OpenCL, Interactive: 20 - 60

                Final Render: 2000+

                Values greater than 2000 don't offer much noticeable improvement.

                Range: 1 - 200,000.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Supersample===

                The value to multiply the dimensions of the histogram and density filter buffer by
                to help eliminate jagged lines. During interactive editing, it should always be one,
                and should only be increased when preparing for a final render. Values greater than one
                will greatly impact performance and will increase memory usage.
                                    
                While a value of 2 offers some visual improvement, values greater than 2 don't offer noticeable improvement.

                Range: 1 - 4.

                Render State: Full render.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Affine Interpolation===

                The method to use when interpolating affine transforms during animation. This value has no effect on the
                interactive renderer, however it's stored in the Xml when saved.

                Render State: Unchanged.
            </li>

            <li>
                ===Interpolation===

                The method to use when interpolating flames during animation. This value has no effect on the
                interactive renderer, however it's stored in the Xml when saved.

                Render State: Unchanged.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
