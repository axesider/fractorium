                        =====Save Current as Xml=====

                        Save the current flame to an Xml file. If it has not yet been saved, a file save dialog will be shown. On subsequent saves, no dialog will be shown
                        and it will use the filename specified the first time the dialog was shown.

                        =====Save Entire File as Xml=====

                        Save the all currently open flames to a single Xml file. If it has not yet been saved, a file save dialog will be shown. On subsequent saves, no dialog will be shown
                        and it will use the filename specified the first time the dialog was shown.

                        Save the current flame back to the open flame list in memory. This does not save anything to disk.

                        =====Exit=====

                        =====Undo=====

                        Revert to the previous edit. The undo list is updated upon completion of the rendering process, when not traversing the undo list.
                        
                        If an edit is made while traversing the list, the list is cleared.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Redo=====

                        If traversing the undo list, move forward to the next edit.

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Copy All Xmls=====

                    <li>
                        =====Paste Xml Append=====

                        Paste the current clipboard text as a flame appended to the list of currently opened flames.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Paste Xml Over=====

                        Paste the current clipboard text over the list of currently opened flames. This will clear whatever is currently open.

                        Render State: Full render.

                        =====Add Reflective Symmetry=====

                        Add an xform that will reflect the image along the Y axis. This is accomplished by giving the xform a weight of one, color speed of 0 and
                        a single linear variation with a weight of one. Its affine is centered on 0,0 with X at -1,0 and Y at 0,1.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Add Rotational Symmetry=====

                        Add an xform that will duplicate a rotated portion of the image along the Y axis. This is accomplished by giving the xform a weight of one, color speed of 0 and
                        a single linear variation with a weight of one. Its affine is centered on 0,0 with X at -1,0 and Y at 0,-1.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Add Reflective and Rotational Symmetry=====

                        Add two xforms, one for reflective symmetry and another for rotational symmetry.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        =====Clear Flame=====

                        Clear the current flame such that it only has one xform with no variations, pre and post affine transforms set to the identity matrix, and no xaos.

                        Render State: Full render.
                    </li>

                        =====Final Render=====

                        Display the final rendering dialog. This will stop the render, and restart it from the beginning when the dialog is closed.

                        Render State: Full render.
