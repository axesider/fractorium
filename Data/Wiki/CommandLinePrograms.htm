=Introduction=

Usage of EmberRender, EmberAnimate and EmberGenome command line programs.

These are advanced tools mostly used in a scripted environment.


=Details=

These programs are replacements for the original flam3-render, flam3-animate and flam3-genome programs. They function the same and produce identical output, however they offer two major advantages over the originals:

-Option to use OpenCL renderer.<br>
-Ability to use command line arguments in addition to environment variables. The originals only supported the latter.<br>

Running any with the `--help` argument will provide a list of the options available to that program.

More information on the what these do and the options to pass them can be found in the original flam3 documentation here:

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/flam3/wiki/Flam3Animate">EmberAnimate</a>

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/flam3/wiki/Flam3Genome">EmberGenome</a>


The only option omitted was `field` which was used to render progressive scanned images for animations. Modern LCD/LED displays overcome the need for this.
