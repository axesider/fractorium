        ==Histogram Bounds==

        When the histogram is allocated before starting a render, it does not have the exact dimensions the user requested. Instead, it is slightly larger
        to allow for filter padding around the edges. The box helps the user understand the relationship between the Cartesian space the histogram represents and the
        dimensions of the memory allocated for it. This is mostly of engineering interest.

        The corners going clockwise from the top left correspond to the bounds of the Cartesian space the histogram represents. They are upper left,
        upper right, lower right, lower left.

        The values in the middle of the top and left sides of the box represent the height and width of the histogram in memory.

                ===Gutter===

                The amount of padding added to the edges of the histogram to allow for filtering.

            <li>
                ===DE Box Dimensions===

                The size of the density filtering box used, with the pixel being filtered in the center. This value is used in calculating the gutter.
