0.9.9.0 Beta 09/19/2015 (Major contributions from Simon Detheridge)
--User changes
	-Add option to display affines in polar coords.
	-Show OpenCL program build errors on info tab, when compilation fails.
	-Add color curves adjustment widget and corresponding entry in the flame xml file.
	-Add the ability to delete/select an ember at a given index in EmberFile with delete and enter keys.
	-Add the ability to save ember Xmls to an unique automatically generated name after the first time the user has specified a name.
	-Add automatic filename padding to animations in EmberAnimate and Fractorium.
	-Allow for multiple palette files rather than hard coding to flam3-palettes.xml.
	-Make xaos display a matrix in its own tab rather than a single column in the xforms tab.
	-Remove xaos from/to button since it's no longer applicable.
	-Add the ability to apply operations to a selection of xforms, rather than just the current one.
	-Add the ability to set the current xform by pressing F1 - F32.
	-Add the ability to toggle an entire row or column of xaos values.
	-Add the ability to click the right mouse button and drag to adjust values in spinners.
	-Allow for toggling row and column of affine tables.
	-Add the ability to copy and paste xforms between flames.
	-Allow for setting rendering thread priorities.
	-Show estimated time left on the final render dialog.
	-Sort palette list by name, instead of by index in the palette file.
	-Sorting can be flipped by clicking the column headers of the palette table.
	-Allow for detaching of top level tabs in the dock widget so workspaces can be customized and saved between runs.
	-Add linked xform support, with new button and icon on the xforms tab.
	-Add an additional animation motion function named Saw (Simon Detheridge).
	-Add motion support at the ember level instead of just individual xforms (Simon Detheridge).
	-Add an offset to existing motion elements, to start them partway through their cycle.
	-Add Summary tab to the info dock, place existing bounds related info in a new Bounds tab.
	-Add a toolbar with the most common actions on it, remove old toolbar at the top of the library tab.
	-Add variations filter/selection dialog that applied to randoms and is also saved in the settings.
	-Remove Hue as a saved parameter, as well as animation parameters associated with it. It's now a GUI-only field that is never saved.
	-Make histogram, density filter buffer, and all associated fields always float, even when using double. In that case, only the iteration calculations are now double. Suggested by Thomas Ludwig.
	-Print all three kernels in EmberRender when the --dump_kernel option is specified.
	-Add Simon Detheridge's name to the About Box.
	-Add support for multiple GPU devices.
		--These options are present in the command line and in Fractorium.
		--Change scheme of specifying devices from platform, device to just total device index.
			---Single number on the command line.
			---Change from combo boxes for device selection to a table of all devices in Fractorium.
	-Temporal samples defaults to 100 instead of 1000 which was needless overkill.
	-Make combo boxes have zero margins, they were getting clipped on Linux.
	-Make xform weight cell slightly wider, it was getting clipped on Linux.
	-Adjust height of final render dialog to make it look better on Linux.
	
--Bug Fixes
	-Fix status bar height on retina displays.
	-Reduce the amount of ComputeCamera() and MakeDmap() calls on each incremental iter that doesn't use temporal samples.
	-Fix clamping bug with DE filter widths.
	-Prevent extra newline in EmberRender when only rendering a single image.
	-Add and call ClearFinalImages() to clear buffers in controller to fix bug where previous CPU render would be shown for a split second when switching from OpenCL back to CPU.
	-Refactor ember library pointer syncing to a function SyncPointers().
	-Use a non-imbued stringstream to generate output filename.
	-Fix NAN in equalized weight calculation when all weights are set to 0.
	-Prevent xform index flickering whenever changing the number of xforms.
	-Fix tab tool tips again.
	-Only correct variation names/params during parsing when the source of the Xml file is not from Ember/Fractorium.

	-Allow for empty fields in template files.
	-Better application wide exception handling and diagnostics.
	-Put Nvidia block size in DE back to 24 where it used to be. Nvidia fails when it's 32.
	-Fix misspelling of the word "Rendering" in failure messages in final render dialog.
	-Properly disable add final xform button when a final xform is present.
	-Move some kernel initialization to a place where it's done once per render, rather than on every interactive iter chunk.
	-FractoriumXformsColor.cpp: Checking for null pixmap pointer is not enough, must also check if the underlying buffer is null via call to QPixmap::isNull().
	-Remove some old style sheet code on the xforms tab that doesn't seem to make sense and was probably just a workaround for a transient Qt bug, of which there are hundreds.
	-Set auto fill background for all of the nested tabs on the ui. This has ping ponged back and forth since the beginning of this project.
	
--Code Changes
	-General code cleanup in many places.
	-Major work to build on Mac and Linux.
	-Better use of const functions.
	-Force all float literals in OpenCL variations to correct precision.

	-Provide functions to return the kernels from RendererCL to assist with diagnostics and debugging.
	-Remove unnecessary resize() in Interpolate().
	-Explicitly namespace calls to sqrt() and isnan().
	-Clean up strange nested usage of Update([&]()) calls when changing xform color index via either the spinner or scroll bar. Made no sense.
	-Make ISAAC RandBit() use RandByte() to be slightly more efficient.
	-Put FillXforms() in the controller where it belongs, rather than the main window class.
	-Add UpdateXform() function to the controller to handle applying operations to multiple xforms.
	-Remove the word "Current" out of most xform related functions because they now operate on whatever is selected.
	-Properly use Update() for various xform operations whereas before it was manually calling UpdateRender().
	-Also properly use Update() in places where it was erroneously using UpdateXform() for things that did not involve xforms.
	-Block signals in FillXaosTable().
	-Add new file named FractoriumXformsSelect.cpp to handle new xform selection code.
	-Remove ForEach() wrappers and replace with range based for loops with auto.

	-Make event filter application wide.
	-Add parameter to FillXforms() to specify the index to select, default 0.
	-Rename some scroll areas and layouts to names that make sense, rather than their designer defaults.
	-Fix some pedantic gcc errors about missing template keyword.
	-Use QTableView instead of QTableWidget for the xaos table.
	-Remove unnecessary connect() statement in Variations tab.
	-Variation tree and associated widgets no longer actually contain variation objects, only IDs.
	-Refactor code to make a color visible on a background into VisibleColor() in FractoriumCommon.h
	-Add IsXformLinked() to determine if an xform is linked to another.
	-Remove SetPaletteRefTable() and GetQRgbFromPaletteIndex() from FractoriumEmberControllerBase and its derivations, unused.
	-Add FillSummary() to FractoriumEmberController. Call in Update(), UpdateXform() and other places where values are changed to force an update of the summary view.
	-Add export statements to FractoriumInfo.cpp.
	-Remove image parameter from SetPaletteTableItem(), it was a bad design.
	-Refactor code to get a palette color at a given index and convert it to a QColor to ColorIndexToQColor().
	-Remove a file named Fractorium.aps which had been erroneously committed a year ago.
	-Use qobject_cast instead of dynamic_cast where appropriate.
	-Add more override keyword where appropriate.
	-Add small function ShutdownAndRecreateFromOptions() to wrap shutting down the timer and recreating the renderer.
	-Use the overridden accept() and reject() functions more consistently across dialogs.
	-De-templatized DEOpenCLKernelCreator and FinalAccumOpenCLKernelCreator. They now just take a bool as a parameter to specify double precision.
	-To accommodate the buffers being float, introduce a new #define types in EmberCL called real4_bucket, and real4reals_bucket.
	-Density and spatial filtering structs now use this type.
	-ConvertDensityFilter() and ConvertSpatialFilter() no longer return a value, they just assign to the member.
	-Make ConvertCarToRas() just assign to the member rather than return a struct.

	Slightly different grid/block logic when running DE filtering on the GPU.
	Attempt a different way of doing DE, but #define out because it ended up not being faster.
	Restructure some things to allow for a variable length xforms buffer to be passed to the GPU.
	Add sub batch size and fuse count as ember members, and remove them from the renderer classes.
	Remove m_LastPass from Renderer. It should have been removed with passes.
	Pass seeds as a buffer to the OpenCL iteration kernel, rather than a single seed that gets modified.

	Two severe OpenCL bugs. Random seeds were biased and fusing was being reset too often leading to results that differ from the CPU.
	Subtle, but sometimes severe bug in the setup of the xaos weights.
	Use properly defined epsilon by getting the value from std::numeric_limits, rather than hard coding 1e-6 or 1e-10.
	Omit incorrect usage of epsilon everywhere. It should not be automatically added to denominators. Rather, it should only be used if the denominator is zero.
	Force final render progress bars to 100 on completion. Sometimes they didn't seem to make it there.
	Make variation name and params comparisons be case insensitive.
	
--Code Changes
	Make ForEach and FindIf wrappers around std::for_each and std::find_if.

0.4.0.1 Beta 07/06/2014

	The wrong visibility value was being used on final xforms.
	The options dialog was not being restored to the previous UI state when the user clicked cancel.
	Pie variation was not properly using the slices parameter.
	Erroneously included gutter when computing bounds and units of OpenGL display window.
	Needlessly calling floor() when calculating histogram index during point accumulation.

--Code Changes

Ember
	Add new fields and functions for 3D projection.
	Add new export macro to handle pre, regular and post variations.
	Add function to get a list of pointers to the variations present in all xforms with no duplicates and only single entries for reg, pre and post types. Used to construct OpenCL function strings.
	Better calling of CacheXforms() in interpolate.

EmberAnimate, EmberGenome, EmberRender
	Print platform and device information when running with OpenCL.

EmberCLFunctions
	Add new global math functions to correspond to the ones added in Utils.

EmberCLStructs
	Add support for 3D fields.
	Make m_LastXfUsed be a member of PointCL, rather than a local variable declared in the kernel.

EmberDefines
	Add a define to only instantiate float type. Useful for reducing build times while debugging, and removed on release.
	Add defines: M_2PI, M_3PI, CUBE, TLOW, TMAX, m3T, acosh and fma. The last two will be removed once the project moves to C++11 in the future.

EmberFile
	Add UniqueFilename() function to ensure what we save is never overwritten with subsequent saves.

EmberTester
	Add many test functions to test the integrity of the Variations design. This will be made into a formal testing suite in the future, but for now is just a collection of global functions.

EmberToXml
	Write out legacy symmetry field in addition to color speed for each xform.
	Write out name field for each xform for Apo compatibility.

FinalRenderDialog
	Add MoveCursorToEnd() signal function to be called from the final render thread.

FinalRenderEmberController
	Call invokeMethod to move cursor to the end rather than directly. This was possibly causing intermittent crashes before.

	Use new SetParamVal() function for interpolating all params. This ensures the interpolated values are in the proper range specified by each variation.
	Use M_2PI constant.

Isaac
	Make ALPHA template argument 4 instead of 8 for more compactness.
	Make functions inline.
	Add check for modulo zero in ranged Rand().

Iterator
	Add support for 3D projections.
	During fuse loop, iterate on the same point rather than to the samples buffer to be more cache friendly. Gives a ~1% speedup.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Add support for 3D projections.
	Add support for new pre/reg/post variation design.
	Directly assign points rather than doing one field at a time.

PaletteList
	Remove Isaac member and use the new global one instead.

Point
	Add m_Z member for 3D.

Renderer
	Make temporary Isaac seeds buffer match 1 << ISAAC_SIZE, rather than hard code to 256.

RendererCL
	Copy new 3D and DC fields to EmberCL object.

Utils
	Add a global Isaac object for use in places where none exists. Only to be used in single threaded scenarios.
	Add many functions for use in new variations: ClampMod(), ClampLteRef(), Sign(), Sqr(), SafeSqrt(), Cube(), Hypot(), Spread(), Powq4(), Powq4c(), Zeps(), Lerp(), Fabsmod(), Fosc(), Foscn(), LogScale(), LogMap().
	Add new int Floor<T>(T val) function that is faster than the system floor() and use it everywhere. Time test proved to be faster.

Variation
	Complete redesign of variations. Split into multiple files to avoid one becoming unweildy.
	Each variation will have a type: pre, regular or post, and will have an assignment type that dictates how the results will be assigned to the output points: direct assign or sum, to be used in pre and post variations. Regular ones always sum.
	Variation enums are now sorted alphabetically rather than the traditional arbitrary sorting of flam3.
	Add Precalc() and PrecalcOpenCLString() functions to be called with pre and post variations. Placed here instead of xform because they depend on the variation type, pre or post.
	Add additional functions to help handle pre/post logic and naming.
	Add fields to specify valid value ranges for parametric params. Taken from Apo.
	Reserve 5 for params vector in parametric variations.
	Add randomization function for parametric variations.
	Use new range and value checked Set() function in CopyParamVals() instead of directly assigning values.
	Add non-null checks in copy macros to delete to prevent a memory leak.
	Add new macros to handle creating and copying pre and post variations.
	
VariationList
	Add new macro for handling the adding of pre, regular, and post variations.
	Add three new vectors to hold pointers, but not copies, to pre, regular and post variations.
	Add helper function GetVariationCopy().
	
Xform
	Add direct color support.
	Major rework of Apply() function to use new style of pre/reg/post variations as well as direct coloring.

XmlToEmber
	Add support for 3D fields, direct color, and the legacy symmetry field.
	Correct poorly named variations and their parameters.
	Remove Isaac member and use the new global one instead.

	
0.3.7.3 Beta 05/04/2014 (Intermediate commit without an associated release)
--User Changes
	Fix a bug that reset the render when adjusting a parameter of a variation whose weight was zero. Now only update the render if the variation is actually present with a non-zero weight.

	Preserve xform index during undo/redo.
	In EmberRender and EmberAnimate, report iters as ran/requested rather than requested/ran.

--Code Changes
Solution

Ember
	Fixed a bug when adding symmetry to an ember that sorted all of the xforms by color speed value, instead of only the newly added symmetry xforms.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Fixed a bug where final xform was considered for the randomly selected xform during each iteration. It was never actually hit, but should have never been there regardless.
	Major change in how bad values were being handled. They were failing out on nVidia but running ok on AMD, but giving worse images. Now it's done in a while loop to avoid severe warp divergence.


0.3.7.1 Beta 04/07/2014
--User Changes
	Fixed a bug that accidentally disabled double precision support on nVidia cards in the last commit.


0.3.7.0 Beta 04/06/2014

	Allow for 21 xforms per ember, was previously 17.

RendererCL
	Support AMD.
	Limit variations per xform to MAX_CL_VARS.

Fractorium
	New functions to allow updating the preview renders from within a thread better.

FractoriumLibrary
	Better flushing of event queues when starting and stopping preview renderer.
	Place a try/catch block around EmberTreeItemChanged() because it seems to get called spurriously for tree items that have already been deleted.

FractoriumEmberController
	Fix bug where Fractorium would crash when opening a new file before the preview renders were finished by doing two things: Updating the thumbnail via invokeMethod() and using BlockingQueuedConnection for that call.


0.3.6.0 Beta 03/11/2014
--User Changes
	Fix bug when using early clip.
	Fix crash when more than once device is present.
	Fix bug where saving the current Xml would continually prompt.

	Bug fix in EmberGenome that would crash when creating a sequence that included embers with final Xforms in them.

--Code Changes

Ember
	Add two members to preserve the original raster width and height of an ember as it was read from file. This is used for aspect ratio calculations later on.
	
EmberDefines
	Add two new enums for render status and scaling preference.

EmberToXml
	Make some buffers size 128 instead of 100.
	Add function AddFilenameWithoutAmpersand() to ensure an ampersand is never added to the edits because Xml can't parse those.
	Error in ConvertLinearToPolar() was calling GetXform(). Changed to GetTotalXform().

PaletteList
	Use a string instead of a vector because it's needed now to deal with ampersands.

Renderer, RendererCL
	Rendering functions now no longer return just true or false. Rather, they return an enum indicating whether it ran ok, with an error, or aborted.
	Ok function was inadvertently made not to be an override in OpenCL. Fixed by adding const to match the base.

SheepTools
	Clean up to use our modern design instead of some remnants left over from flam3.
	Consolidate variation weight normalization to a function call, NormalizeVariationWeights().

Utils
	Add some functionality to EmberReport.
	Add a function FindAndReplace() to replace all isntances of a value within a collection with a specified value.

FinalRenderEmberController
	Add support for preview renders.
	Support for new scaling features.

	Add previews to open embers in the Library tab.
	Allow for starting and stopping the preview renderer.
	Make library tab first and automatically selected.

	Holding shift while scrolling xform weight adjusts the value by 0.001 for more precise manipulation.

--Code Changes

CarToRas
	Prevent assign to self.
	Remove padded variables for bounds checking, and check bounds properly. Also discovered that even when points are in bounds, the roundoff error from converting to raster can put them out of bounds. Add a final check in Accum.

DensityFilter
	General cleanup.
	Save the filter width (oddly enough, this wasn't being done before).
	Add a vector of indices that is used in OpenCL to apply the filter by row, rather than moving from the center outward. This fixes a race condition when applying the DE filter on the GPU.
	Remove FinalMinRad, FinalMaxRad and ActualMaxRad members and accessor functions.

Affine2D, Color, Ember, Palette, Point, Variation, Xform
	Prevent assign to self.

Renderer

	In GaussianDensityFilter(), do a more optimized assignment of the bucket hit count if SS=1.
	Reorder the assignments for the case (jj == ii) to be cache efficient.
	In Accumulate(), add one final check after Car to Ras conversion to make absolutely sure it's within bounds. This was the source of a seldom occurring, but lethal memory error.

EmberToXml
	Clamp supersample to always be greater than 1 just to be safe.

XmlToEmber
	Add a Parse() overload that takes a vector<unsigned char>.
	More consistent formatting of error messages.
	Add, but comment out, an attempt to capture missing variations when parsing. Revisit later.

FractoriumEmberController, FractoriumMenus
	Properly account for scale when opening from file, dragging and dropping, or pasting Xmls into the GUI.

FractoriumParams
	Allow brightness to go to 50 and gamma to go to 9999.
	Allow spatial filter width to go down to 0.1, was 0.4 before.

FractoriumRender
	Renderer was not properly being created when returning from options if params other than OpenCL or double precision were changed. Now properly construct for all options changes.

FractoriumSettings
	Default XmlSupersample to 2 if not found in settings file.

FractoriumXformsAffine
	Respect world vs. local pivot when flipping affine to mimic Apophysis behavior. Was previously always using world pivot behavior.
	
FractoriumXformsColor
	NULL check for empty pixmap on startup.

GLWidget
	Check for m_Init in SetSelectedXform() to avoid recursive paint operation.

EmberCLStructs
	Remove pad members from CarToRas structures to mirrow the CPU side.
	
EmberCLFunctions
	Remove AddToAccum functions, they are no longer used with new DE code. Add AccumCheck() function to check bounds, but not accumulate.
	Change CarToRasInBounds() to check bounds the same way the new CPU code does.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Add histSize parameter to kernel.
	Add (histIndex < histSize) check after call to CarToRasConvertPointToSingle() to match the extra check done on the CPU side now. This will guarantee memory errors will never happen while iterating.

RendererCL
	Add support for different block widths and heights for DE.
	Add a DE coefficients buffer for applying DE by row, which fixes the race condition problem that occurs when applying from the center outward.
	DE blocksize is now 32x32, unless SS>1 or type is double, in which case they run at 32x30.
	Add debugging code in GaussianDensityFilter() to fall back to the CPU for testing, leave commented out.

DEOpenCLKernelCreator
	Re-design to apply filter by row, rather than from the center outward. This solves the race condition error that would lead to missing pixels on some images.
	Eliminate needless variables and make every effort to get the kernel as compact as possible. This allows running a block size of 32x32.
	Rename blockHistCol and blockHistRow to threadHistCol and threadHistRow since that's what they are.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), have the last row accumulate since it's slightly faster than having the first row do it.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), Change the local buffer to be size 3000.


0.3.1.0 Beta 01/06/2014
--User Changes
	Changing size when dragging in an image (orig -> window), resizing (window -> window), or doing a final render (window -> final render) now compensates for scale (pixels per unit).
	Spatial filter width now allows values >= 0 and defaults to 0.4.
	All spinners now scroll by the normal step / 10 when holding shift. Variation spinners are a special case and scroll by 0.001 with shift held down.
	Final render now shows pure render time along with total time.	
	Fix bug in final render dialog where only the first image in the file would get rendered.
	Installer will now uninstall the previous version automatically.
	Installer now includes this file.
	About box now fully specifies version with 4 digits.
