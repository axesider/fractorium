EmberFile
	Add UniqueFilename() function to ensure what we save is never overwritten with subsequent saves.

EmberTester
	Add many test functions to test the integrity of the Variations design. This will be made into a formal testing suite in the future, but for now is just a collection of global functions.

EmberToXml
	Write out legacy symmetry field in addition to color speed for each xform.
	Write out name field for each xform for Apo compatibility.

FinalRenderDialog
	Add MoveCursorToEnd() signal function to be called from the final render thread.

FinalRenderEmberController

	Add new int Floor<T>(T val) function that is faster than the system floor() and use it everywhere. Time test proved to be faster.

Variation
	Complete redesign of variations. Split into multiple files to avoid one becoming unweildy.
	Each variation will have a type: pre, regular or post, and will have an assignment type that dictates how the results will be assigned to the output points: direct assign or sum, to be used in pre and post variations. Regular ones always sum.
	Variation enums are now sorted alphabetically rather than the traditional arbitrary sorting of flam3.
	Add Precalc() and PrecalcOpenCLString() functions to be called with pre and post variations. Placed here instead of xform because they depend on the variation type, pre or post.
	Add additional functions to help handle pre/post logic and naming.
	Add fields to specify valid value ranges for parametric params. Taken from Apo.
	Reserve 5 for params vector in parametric variations.
	Add randomization function for parametric variations.

	Fixed a bug when adding symmetry to an ember that sorted all of the xforms by color speed value, instead of only the newly added symmetry xforms.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Fixed a bug where final xform was considered for the randomly selected xform during each iteration. It was never actually hit, but should have never been there regardless.
	Major change in how bad values were being handled. They were failing out on nVidia but running ok on AMD, but giving worse images. Now it's done in a while loop to avoid severe warp divergence.


0.3.7.1 Beta 04/07/2014
--User Changes
	Fixed a bug that accidentally disabled double precision support on nVidia cards in the last commit.


0.3.7.0 Beta 04/06/2014

Fractorium
	New functions to allow updating the preview renders from within a thread better.

FractoriumLibrary
	Better flushing of event queues when starting and stopping preview renderer.
	Place a try/catch block around EmberTreeItemChanged() because it seems to get called spurriously for tree items that have already been deleted.

FractoriumEmberController
	Fix bug where Fractorium would crash when opening a new file before the preview renders were finished by doing two things: Updating the thumbnail via invokeMethod() and using BlockingQueuedConnection for that call.

	Bug fix in EmberGenome that would crash when creating a sequence that included embers with final Xforms in them.

--Code Changes

Ember
	Add two members to preserve the original raster width and height of an ember as it was read from file. This is used for aspect ratio calculations later on.
	
EmberDefines
	Add two new enums for render status and scaling preference.

EmberToXml
	Make some buffers size 128 instead of 100.
	Add function AddFilenameWithoutAmpersand() to ensure an ampersand is never added to the edits because Xml can't parse those.
	Error in ConvertLinearToPolar() was calling GetXform(). Changed to GetTotalXform().

PaletteList
	Use a string instead of a vector because it's needed now to deal with ampersands.

Renderer, RendererCL
	Rendering functions now no longer return just true or false. Rather, they return an enum indicating whether it ran ok, with an error, or aborted.
	Ok function was inadvertently made not to be an override in OpenCL. Fixed by adding const to match the base.

SheepTools
	Clean up to use our modern design instead of some remnants left over from flam3.
	Consolidate variation weight normalization to a function call, NormalizeVariationWeights().

Utils
	Add some functionality to EmberReport.

	Holding shift while scrolling xform weight adjusts the value by 0.001 for more precise manipulation.

--Code Changes

CarToRas
	Prevent assign to self.
	Remove padded variables for bounds checking, and check bounds properly. Also discovered that even when points are in bounds, the roundoff error from converting to raster can put them out of bounds. Add a final check in Accum.

DensityFilter
	General cleanup.
	Save the filter width (oddly enough, this wasn't being done before).
	Add a vector of indices that is used in OpenCL to apply the filter by row, rather than moving from the center outward. This fixes a race condition when applying the DE filter on the GPU.
	Remove FinalMinRad, FinalMaxRad and ActualMaxRad members and accessor functions.

Affine2D, Color, Ember, Palette, Point, Variation, Xform
	Prevent assign to self.

Renderer

	In GaussianDensityFilter(), do a more optimized assignment of the bucket hit count if SS=1.
	Reorder the assignments for the case (jj == ii) to be cache efficient.
	In Accumulate(), add one final check after Car to Ras conversion to make absolutely sure it's within bounds. This was the source of a seldom occurring, but lethal memory error.

EmberToXml
	Clamp supersample to always be greater than 1 just to be safe.

XmlToEmber
	Add a Parse() overload that takes a vector<unsigned char>.
	More consistent formatting of error messages.
	Add, but comment out, an attempt to capture missing variations when parsing. Revisit later.

FractoriumEmberController, FractoriumMenus
	Properly account for scale when opening from file, dragging and dropping, or pasting Xmls into the GUI.

FractoriumParams
	Allow brightness to go to 50 and gamma to go to 9999.
	Allow spatial filter width to go down to 0.1, was 0.4 before.

FractoriumRender
	Renderer was not properly being created when returning from options if params other than OpenCL or double precision were changed. Now properly construct for all options changes.

FractoriumSettings
	Default XmlSupersample to 2 if not found in settings file.

FractoriumXformsAffine
	Respect world vs. local pivot when flipping affine to mimic Apophysis behavior. Was previously always using world pivot behavior.
	
FractoriumXformsColor
	NULL check for empty pixmap on startup.

GLWidget
	Check for m_Init in SetSelectedXform() to avoid recursive paint operation.

EmberCLStructs
	Remove pad members from CarToRas structures to mirrow the CPU side.
	
EmberCLFunctions
	Remove AddToAccum functions, they are no longer used with new DE code. Add AccumCheck() function to check bounds, but not accumulate.
	Change CarToRasInBounds() to check bounds the same way the new CPU code does.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Add histSize parameter to kernel.
	Add (histIndex < histSize) check after call to CarToRasConvertPointToSingle() to match the extra check done on the CPU side now. This will guarantee memory errors will never happen while iterating.

RendererCL
	Add support for different block widths and heights for DE.
	Add a DE coefficients buffer for applying DE by row, which fixes the race condition problem that occurs when applying from the center outward.
	DE blocksize is now 32x32, unless SS>1 or type is double, in which case they run at 32x30.
	Add debugging code in GaussianDensityFilter() to fall back to the CPU for testing, leave commented out.

DEOpenCLKernelCreator
	Re-design to apply filter by row, rather than from the center outward. This solves the race condition error that would lead to missing pixels on some images.
	Eliminate needless variables and make every effort to get the kernel as compact as possible. This allows running a block size of 32x32.
	Rename blockHistCol and blockHistRow to threadHistCol and threadHistRow since that's what they are.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), have the last row accumulate since it's slightly faster than having the first row do it.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), Change the local buffer to be size 3000.


0.3.1.0 Beta 01/06/2014
--User Changes
	Changing size when dragging in an image (orig -> window), resizing (window -> window), or doing a final render (window -> final render) now compensates for scale (pixels per unit).
	Spatial filter width now allows values >= 0 and defaults to 0.4.
	All spinners now scroll by the normal step / 10 when holding shift. Variation spinners are a special case and scroll by 0.001 with shift held down.
	Final render now shows pure render time along with total time.	
	Fix bug in final render dialog where only the first image in the file would get rendered.
	Installer will now uninstall the previous version automatically.
	Installer now includes this file.
	About box now fully specifies version with 4 digits.

--Code Changes
-Ember
	Add function SetSizeAndAdjustScale() to adjust the scale for a size change.

-RendererCL
	Report error when adding spatial filter params fails, which can happen when GPU memory runs out.
